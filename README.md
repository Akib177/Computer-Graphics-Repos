The project about a game name "Flappy Bird"
In the game we use only simple openGl functions. Here have cloud, sky, grass as a background only using rectengulers, circles, lines. We make the bird using only rectengulers, circles. The pipes are made with rectenguler, and it moves using only timer function.
